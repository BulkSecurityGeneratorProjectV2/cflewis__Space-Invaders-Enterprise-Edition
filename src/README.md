Space Invaders Enterprise Edition
=================================
Space Invaders Enterprise Edition is a version of [Coke and Code](http://www.cokeandcode.com/spaceinvaderstutorial)'s Space Invaders implementation, but all the game logic is represented as a [Drools](http://www.jboss.org/drools) rule file, rather than written in Java.
